# rick_and_morty

A full flutter application that provides info on rick and morty show 

## key points
- this app is made for training purposes only
- didnt focus on design my focus was to implement the concepts i've learned with a clean code archticture
- havent added the ability to search because the api doesnt support it yet but in the near future it'll be there
- tried a few new topics to me like basic animations
- overall it was a fun and learnt much from building this app

## to do 
- make the onboarding screen appear only in the first time  a user launch the app
- sneaky way to implement search
.
